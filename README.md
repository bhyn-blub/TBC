# Technical Services Fault Diagnosis Intelligence Pill

A deterministic, audit-ready agent for diagnosing technical-services faults on
critical data-center assets (CRAH units, chillers, pumps, UPS). Built for the
Keppel **AI HARVEST** hackathon.

> **The pitch:** Data-centre faults are diagnosed by a handful of senior
> technicians — when they retire, that judgement retires with them. TBC turns
> their know-how into a governed **Intelligence Pill**: an AI drafts structured
> heuristics from an interview, a *different* knowledge steward approves them,
> and every later diagnosis reuses that knowledge with the expert's name and
> verbatim quote attached — under deterministic guardrails, a tamper-evident
> audit trail, and human-only approval of every action.

> **Design principle: AI in the harvest, determinism in the execution.**
> An LLM turns expert interviews into draft knowledge (see *Expert Knowledge
> Capture*), but nothing it drafts goes live until a second knowledge steward
> approves it. Diagnosis itself is deterministic: the same observation and
> evidence always yield the same diagnosis, recommendation and guardrail
> verdict, so every run is auditable and unit-testable.

## Quantifiable metrics

**Measured in this repo** (reproduce with `make test` / `make eval` / `GET /kb/stats`):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Test suite | **133 pytest**, all passing, zero configuration |
| Acceptance evals | **13/13** labelled evals (`make eval`) |
| Asset classes / fault trees | **4** (CRAH temperature, chiller compressor trip, UPS battery, pump vibration) |
| Canonical causes | **24** IDs (23 decision-tree causes + 1 `unresolvable` sentinel), one registry |
| Guardrails | **9** (G1–G9), deterministic, running before any recommendation or work order |
| Agent lifecycle | **11 states / 16 transitions**, every transition hash-chained (SHA-256) |
| RBAC | **5 roles, 6 demo users, 33 API endpoints**, enforcement tested server-side |
| Knowledge governance | **0** knowledge items can go live without a second steward's approval; every KB version rollback-able |
| Demo tour | **8-step** in-app guided tour + **6-minute** scripted run (`DEMO.md`) |

**Business value — explicitly labelled assumptions, not Keppel data:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Manual triage without captured knowledge | *assumption:* ≈90 minutes per fault (baseline to be replaced with a measured Keppel figure) |
| Diagnosis with this pill | seconds, deterministic, with any matching approved expert knowledge shown alongside |
| Knowledge retention on expert departure | interviews remain as steward-approved, versioned knowledge instead of leaving with the expert |
| Learning effect, demonstrated | one approved feedback cycle lifts `kb_match` 0.73 → 1.00 and confidence 0.43 → 0.50 on the next identical case (`make demo`, CASE 3; exact numbers depend on mock peer sensors) |

confidence score → guardrails (G1-G9) → recommendation → human approval →
work order → outcome → feedback → **validated case written back to KB**
(closed-loop learning).

## Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `models.py` | Pydantic v2 data models, enums, threshold constants. Core 8 agent-state fields: `asset_id`, `observation`, `evidence`, `diagnosis`, `confidence`, `recommendation`, `human_decision`, `outcome`. |
| `agent_state.py` | Deterministic state machine, hash-chain audit history, lifecycle helpers (`trigger`, `add_evidence`, `complete_diagnosis`, `propose_recommendation`, `record_human_decision`, `record_outcome`, `queue_feedback`, `close_escalation`, `request_more_evidence`). |
| `guardrails.py` | LLM-independent guardrail engine G1-G8, plus G9 (`flag_ai_disagreement`) which surfaces the AI second opinion to the AOM without ever changing routing. Runs *before* any recommendation reaches a human or any work order is created. |
| `decision_tree.py` | Executable causal decision trees for CRAH (Q1-Q7), chiller, UPS and pump faults. 23 candidate causes across all four asset types, plus the `unresolvable` sentinel for "the tree found nothing". |
| `confidence.py` | Confidence scorer: `w1·coverage + w2·peer + w3·kb_match − w4·staleness − w5·conflict`. `peer_agreement` comes from real peer sensors/sibling assets in `mock_registry`; `data_staleness`/`conflict_penalty` from real evidence age and contradictions. |
| `ai_reasoning.py` | Advisory AI second opinion on a completed diagnosis: G7-sanitises inputs, calls `llm.diagnostic_second_opinion`, grounds the response, never influences routing. |
| `llm.py` | Provider seam for both expert capture and the AI second opinion (`mock` offline / `adp` Tencent Cloud ADP). |
| `capture.py` | Expert interview → grounded draft knowledge. Every heuristic must quote the transcript verbatim or it's dropped. |
| `cause_registry.py` | Canonical cause IDs, plain-English labels, and which pill owns each cause. |
| `auth.py` | Signed session cookie identity (`POST /login`); `?user=` only works as a fallback under `TBC_DEMO_INSECURE=1`. |
| `tools.py` | Agent tool layer: evidence gatherer, diagnosis orchestrator, guardrail checker, recommendation proposer, work-order creator, feedback submitter. |
| `rbac.py` | 5-role RBAC matrix (technician, asset_ops_manager, knowledge_steward, auditor, admin). Permission checks via `can()` / `require()`. |
| `store.py` / `database.py` | SQLite-backed `CaseStore` with a memory cache and hash-chain audit trace. |
| `learning.py` | `LearningStore`: validated-case KB, Jaccard similarity retrieval, `kb_match_score()`, feedback → validated-case write-back, proposal workflow. |
| `audit.py` | `canonical_json`, SHA-256 `compute_hash`, `GENESIS_HASH` for hash-chain integrity. |
| `mock_registry.py` | Demo data: 7 assets across 4 pills (2 CRAH, 2 chiller, 1 UPS, 2 pump -- each pill's second asset has a distinct fault signature so more than one captured cause per pill is reachable in a live diagnosis), seed KB, maintenance history, sensor metadata, BMS status. |
| `persistence.py` | FastAPI lifecycle snapshots for cases, KB, proposals, audit. |
| `app.py` | FastAPI app: RBAC-enforced routes, identity, persistence lifecycle, the agent-loop driver, and `/pills`. |
| `demo.py` | End-to-end lifecycle, multi-asset routing, and AI HARVEST capture-to-reuse demo. |

## Quick Start

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Build and start the API server on :8000
docker compose up --build -d

# API available at http://localhost:8000
# Interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
# Health check at http://localhost:8000/kb/stats

# Run the end-to-end demo, including the AI HARVEST loop, inside a container
docker compose run --rm demo

# Teardown
docker compose down
```

### Option B — Local (Python 3.11+)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the test suite
make test

# Run the console demo, including expert capture → approval → reuse
make demo

# Start the API server with hot reload
make serve
```

### Option C - Frontend Demo UI (what judges should run)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make serve          # = PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn frontend.serve:app --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/ui` — the dashboard auto-seeds three demo cases
(one CLOSED, one ESCALATED, one AWAITING_APPROVAL) the first time it loads
empty; click **Seed Demo Cases** any time to add three more. The role
switcher (top right) sets a real signed-in session, not a URL param — see
*Identity and RBAC* below. A **Dark theme** toggle sits next to it; light is
the default (projector-safe, high-contrast — see `tests/test_contrast.py`).
Click **Demo guide** for a guided walkthrough, or follow `DEMO.md` for a
6-minute scripted run. See `frontend/README.md` for UI implementation
details.

The FastAPI app restores state at startup and snapshots successful mutations
to `data/tbc.sqlite` (cases, proposals, KB versions, tool audit log); audit
chains are re-verified on load. This applies to both the API and UI entry
points. `make reset` removes this snapshot database; the separate per-case
SQLite store remains intact. Set `TBC_PERSIST=0` to disable these app-level
snapshots.

### Makefile Targets

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make install` | Install runtime and test dependencies |
| `make test` | Run the full pytest suite |
| `make eval` | Run EVAL-01..12 acceptance evals, print a pass/fail table |
| `make demo` | Run the end-to-end console demo |
| `make serve` | Start the API and UI on `localhost:8000` (open `/ui`) |
| `make reset` | Wipe persisted state for a clean demo |
| `make docker-up` | Build + start the API container in background |
| `make docker-demo` | Run the demo inside a container |
| `make docker-down` | Stop and remove containers |
| `make lint` | Syntax-check all modules via `py_compile` |
| `make clean` | Remove `__pycache__` directories |

## Guardrail Engine (G1-G9)

G1-G8 are **pure Python, deterministic, and LLM-independent**. They run
*before* any recommendation reaches a human and *before* any work order is
created (spec §4.4, Layer 4). G9 is the one exception — it surfaces the
*advisory* AI second opinion, but it is still a pure function of its inputs
and never blocks, escalates, or requires approval.

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Recommendation implies a BMS setpoint / interlock / safety-system / firmware change | Block + escalate |
| **G2** | Fault classified safety-critical (cooling lost **AND** temperature rising) | Must escalate |
| **G2b** | Cause involves environmental/pressure hazard (e.g. refrigerant leak) | Force `AWAITING_APPROVAL` with safety flag (does NOT auto-escalate) |
| **G3** | Root cause maps to another pill's domain (chiller, power, BMS bus, leasing, tenant) | Coordinate + escalate |
| **G4** | `confidence < ESCALATE_CONFIDENCE` (0.35) | Escalate, do not recommend |
| **G5** | Asset not in registry / unknown asset | Escalate (short-circuit, no diagnosis) |
| **G6** | Any recommended action | Force `AWAITING_APPROVAL` — no auto-execute |
| **G7** | Sensor metadata / tag name contains prompt-injection patterns | Sanitize before any LLM sees it |
| **G8** | Recommendation not grounded in `kb_refs` **and** `evidence_refs` | Reject as ungrounded (anti-hallucination) |
| **G9** | The AI second opinion disagrees with the rule-based diagnosis | Flag for the AOM only — never changes routing |

## Decision Trees (multi-asset)

The pill routes by `observation.type` to a **fault-specific causal tree** via a
deterministic dispatcher (`_FAULT_EVALUATORS` in `decision_tree.py`). Adding a
new asset/fault class = write one evaluator function + register it — no caller
changes. Same observation + evidence → same candidates every run.

Currently **four fault types** across **four asset classes** are implemented:

| Fault type (`observation.type`) | Asset | Tree | Causes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `temperature_measurement_missing` | CRAH | Q1-Q7 | 8 (bus / config / wiring / sensor / data-path / intermittent / drift / noise) |
| `chiller_compressor_trip` | Chiller | Q1-Q4 | 5 (leak / undercharge / fouling / motor / electrical) |
| `ups_battery_fault` | UPS | Q1-Q5 | 5 (thermal-runaway / EoL / charger / ground-fault / inverter) |
| `pump_vibration_high` | Pump | Q1-Q5 | 5 (cavitation / misalignment / looseness / bearing / imbalance) |

### CRAH — "temperature measurement missing" (Q1-Q7)

```
Q1  Reading status?
│
├─ INVALID ──▶ Q7 (drift vs fault/noise)
│               ├─ sudden spike / sentinel → sensor_fault_noise
│               ├─ gradual drift / calibration overdue → sensor_drift
│               └─ ambiguous → (no candidate, request more evidence)
│
└─ ABSENT ───▶ Q2  Other tags on same bus reporting?
                ├─ No (bus dead) → comm_bus_failure        [ESCALATE]
                └─ Yes
                   └─▶ Q3  Tag present in config / controller?
                         ├─ Tag renamed/removed → config_drift
                         └─ No change
                            └─▶ Q4  Recent maintenance disturbance?
                                  ├─ sensor_replacement / wiring_inspection → loose_wiring
                                  └─ No disturbance
                                     └─▶ Q5  Sensor past EoL / calibration overdue?
                                           ├─ Yes → sensor_hardware_failure
                                           └─ No
                                              └─▶ Q6  Gateway / SCADA path healthy?
                                                    ├─ No → data_path_drop  [cross-coordinate]
                                                    └─ Yes → intermittent_fault
```

| Cause ID (canonical) | Label | Default Action |
|---|---|---|
| `communication_bus_controller_failure` | Communication bus / controller failure | `controller_inspection` → escalate to BMS vendor |
| `configuration_drift` | Configuration drift (tag missing/renamed) | `config_remap` (approval required, like every action — G6) |
| `loose_wiring_after_service` | Loose wiring / connection disturbed during service | `onsite_inspection` |
| `sensor_hardware_failure` | Sensor hardware failure (RTD/thermistor dead) | `sensor_replacement` |
| `data_path_drop` | Data-path drop (telemetry transport) | `path_restore` → cross-coordinate with IT/Ops |
| `intermittent_fault` | Intermittent sensor fault / borderline failure | `onsite_inspection` (lower confidence) |
| `sensor_drift` | Sensor drift | `sensor_recalibration` |
| `sensor_fault_noise` | Sensor fault or electrical noise | `sensor_inspection` |

> Cause IDs are the canonical long forms (`cause_registry.py`); short forms
> like `comm_bus_failure` or `loose_wiring` are aliases only and are never
> emitted — `GET /causes` and every dropdown/label on screen use the
> canonical form with a plain-English label.

> All cause labels, branch predicates, and thresholds are **illustrative
> expert heuristics** (spec §4.2, Appendix A #5) that must be validated with
> Keppel technical-services SMEs before deployment. They are plain configurable
> Python — versionable, reviewable, and rollback-able via the governance pipeline.

### Chiller — "compressor trip" (Q1-Q4)

| Q | Branch | → Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Low-pressure switch tripped + leak detected | `refrigerant_leak` |
| Q1 | Low-pressure switch tripped + charge < 70% | `low_refrigerant_charge` |
| Q2 | High head pressure / high approach + fans running | `condenser_fouling` |
| Q3 | Motor overcurrent / winding resistance < 0.5 | `compressor_motor_fault` |
| Q4 | Starter / contactor fault | `chiller_electrical_fault` |

### UPS — "battery fault" (Q1-Q5, safety-first ordering)

| Q | Branch | → Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Cell temp ≥ 45 °C **and** rising | `thermal_runaway_risk` (**ESCALATE**) |
| Q2 | SoH < 60% or age ≥ 60 months | `battery_eol` |
| Q3 | Charger fault / no charge current | `charger_failure` |
| Q4 | `ground_fault` alarm | `ground_fault` |
| Q5 | `inverter_fault` alarm | `inverter_fault` |

### Pump — "vibration high" (Q1-Q5, spectrum-driven)

| Q | Branch | → Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Broadband dominant + NPSH margin < 0.3 | `cavitation` |
| Q2 | 2x dominant + axial ≥ 4.5 mm/s | `shaft_misalignment` |
| Q3 | Subharmonic / soft foot / directional | `foundation_looseness` |
| Q4 | Bearing-defect freq / temp ≥ 75 °C / greasing overdue | `bearing_wear` |
| Q5 | 1x dominant, no other symptoms | `impeller_imbalance` |

## Confidence Scoring

```
confidence = W1·evidence_coverage
           + W2·peer_agreement
           + W3·kb_match
           − W4·data_staleness
           − W5·conflict_penalty
```

| Weight | Value | Factor | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | 0.30 | `evidence_coverage` | fraction of decision-tree branches resolvable with retrieved evidence |
| W2 | 0.20 | `peer_agreement` | real peer sensors / sibling assets in `mock_registry` (CRAH today); defaults to 0.5 only where a peer slot exists but is unpopulated, or 1.0 for asset types the registry has no sensor-level model for yet (Chiller/UPS/Pump) |
| W3 | 0.25 | `kb_match` | Jaccard similarity to validated past cases in the KB (RAG) |
| W4 | 0.10 | `data_staleness` | penalty: evidence age vs. a per-source freshness SLA (real evidence timestamps, not a flag) |
| W5 | 0.15 | `conflict_penalty` | penalty: contradictory boolean evidence fields across sources |

The factor bars and the KB version a diagnosis actually used are shown live
on the Diagnosis screen ("Confidence Breakdown"). On Governance, after a
proposal approves, **Re-run Diagnosis on Similar Open Cases** re-scores a
still-open case against the current KB — non-destructively — and shows the
before/after confidence.

**Thresholds** (from `models.py`):

| Constant | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MIN_RECO_CONFIDENCE` | 0.55 | `DIAGNOSING → RECOMMENDING` requires `confidence ≥` this |
| `ESCALATE_CONFIDENCE` | 0.35 | `confidence <` this → `ESCALATED` (no recommendation, G4) |

## Closed-Loop Learning (F2: Proposal Workflow)

The system improves itself through a **feedback → proposal → steward approval → KB
write-back** loop (spec §7, enhanced in F2):

```
  diagnosis ──▶ human feedback ──▶ pending proposal ──▶ steward review
                      │                                        │
                      ▼                                   approve / reject
                 FeedbackRecord                               │
                                                      ┌───────┴───────┐
                                                      ▼               ▼
                                                 ValidatedCase    (discarded)
                                                 written to KB
                                                      │
                                                      ▼
                                                 next diagnosis
                                                 retrieves via Jaccard
                                                 similarity → kb_match ↑
                                                 → confidence ↑
```

1. After a case closes, `submit_feedback` records the human-confirmed (or
   corrected) root cause and creates a **pending proposal** (not directly
   ingested).
2. A knowledge steward reviews the proposal via `/kb/queue` and approves or
   rejects it. Approval ingests the case into the KB and increments the KB
   version.
3. On the **next** diagnosis, `get_similar()` retrieves matching cases and
   `kb_match_score()` returns a similarity in `[0, 1]`.
4. A higher `kb_match` feeds into the W3 term, raising `confidence` — so
   recurring faults are diagnosed faster and with more confidence.
5. An admin can **roll back** the KB to a prior version via `/kb/rollback/{version}`,
   removing all cases added after that version — reachable from the UI via
   the **Rollback** panel on Governance (admin role), which lists every
   addressable version by its displayed label so there's no guessing which
   integer corresponds to "v1.4.0" on screen.

**Demo proof:** the learning-loop case shows `kb_match` rising from **0.73 →
1.00** and confidence from **0.43 → 0.50** after one approved feedback cycle
(`make demo`, CASE 3; the exact numbers move if `mock_registry`'s peer
sensors change, since `peer_agreement` is now computed from them live —
see "Confidence breakdown" below).

**Separation of actors:** whoever proposes a change can never approve it.
`approve_proposal` returns 403 if the approver is the proposer, and the
proposer is always the authenticated caller (a client-supplied
`submitted_by` is ignored). Demo users `steward1` and `steward2` exist so
the second-reviewer rule can be shown live.

## Expert Knowledge Capture (LLM drafts, steward approves)

The challenge's hardest requirement is capturing know-how that was never
written down. The **Capture** screen takes an interview with an experienced
technician and walks four visible steps: Interview, AI draft, You review,
Second steward approves.

```
interview transcript
   │  G7: instruction-like text redacted before any model sees it
   ▼
POST /capture/draft  (llm.py)  ──▶  symptom, likely cause, checks, never-do,
   │                                escalate-when, verbatim evidence quote
   ▼
grounding check: any item whose quote is not in the transcript is DROPPED
cause check:     causes stored as canonical IDs with plain-English labels;
                 causes outside the known universe are flagged "new:<slug>"
filing:          each heuristic is filed under the pill that owns its cause
                 (chiller know-how from a CRAH interview goes to Chiller)
   ▼
capturer reviews: untick wrong items, correct a cause (cannot add words)
   ▼
POST /capture/interview  (re-grounded server-side) ──▶ pending proposal
   ▼
a DIFFERENT knowledge steward approves ──▶ live KB (version bump, rollback-able)
```

Nothing is queued until the capturer sends the reviewed draft, so a
half-wrong draft never reaches the steward queue.

Approved heuristics on known causes enter the validated library, raising
that cause's empirical prior and so the confidence of future diagnoses.
Heuristics proposing a *new* cause stay as knowledge only: the engine cannot
diagnose a cause until an engineer adds a decision-tree branch for it.
On the diagnosis screen, **Expert Knowledge Reused** shows matching approved
heuristics with the source expert, knowledge ID, KB version, interview quote,
and checks. A match requires the same asset type and diagnosed cause; the
decision tree and guardrails remain authoritative.

**Providers** (`TBC_LLM_PROVIDER`):

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `mock` (default) | Deterministic offline extractor, so the demo runs without keys. Labelled "Offline mock model" in the UI. |
| `adp` | Tencent Cloud Agent Development Platform, v2 Chat API over HTTP SSE (`llm._call_adp()`). Failures return HTTP 502, never a silent fallback. |

To use ADP: `cp .env.example .env`, set `TBC_LLM_PROVIDER=adp` and paste your
AppKey (ADP console: your app > Publish > Service status > API management >
Copy) into `ADP_APP_KEY`. `.env` is gitignored. The top bar shows which model
is active.

**Demo guide:** the "Demo guide" button in the top bar walks an eight-step
tour of the whole loop, setting the role and screen for each step.

**Console AI HARVEST proof:** `make demo` also runs a complete interview-to-
reuse scenario: the offline mock extractor drafts grounded heuristics, a
different steward approves them, a new CRAH case reuses matching expert
knowledge, a manager approves the recommendation, and a steward validates
the maintenance outcome into the KB. Set `TBC_LLM_PROVIDER=adp` to use the
configured Tencent ADP provider instead of the default offline mock.

## AI Second Opinion (advisory, never routes)

The same provider seam (`llm.py`) that drafts expert knowledge also produces
an independent second opinion on a *completed* rule-based diagnosis
(`ai_reasoning.py`). It is explicitly advisory:

- Sensor metadata and evidence are G7-sanitised before the model sees them.
- A hypothesis naming a cause outside the candidates offered is rejected; an
  evidence citation not actually present in the supplied evidence is dropped.
- It never approves, executes, publishes, or changes `current_state`. When it
  disagrees with the rule-based diagnosis, that's logged as guardrail **G9**
  — visible to the AOM, changes nothing.
- A timeout or malformed reply falls back to a labelled "AI offline" state;
  the deterministic diagnosis is never blocked by it, and the fallback is
  itself recorded in the hash-chained audit trail.

Shown on the Diagnosis screen as its own card, clearly separate from the
"Rule-based diagnosis (expert decision tree)" card — only the AI card and
Capture ever say "AI".

## Pill Registry

`GET /pills` and the **Pill Registry** panel (Governance) list all four
pills — CRAH, Chiller, UPS, Pump — with their owner steward, current KB
version, knowledge-item count, and approval rate. All four currently share
one knowledge base, so the KB version is identical across rows; that's the
real current architecture, not an invented per-pill version (see
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PATH.md` for the scale path to per-pill isolation).

## Identity and RBAC

`POST /login` sets an HMAC-signed session cookie (`TBC_SECRET`, auto-generated
per process if unset) naming one of six fixed demo users. Every endpoint
resolves its caller from that cookie, which always wins over a `?user=` query
param — `?user=` only works as a fallback when `TBC_DEMO_INSECURE=1` is set
(local demos/tests), and the UI shows a persistent amber banner whenever that
flag is in effect. The top-bar role switcher calls `/login`; it is not a
client-side-only toggle.

| Role | Key Permissions |
|---|---|
| `technician` | Create cases, gather evidence, read diagnosis, record outcomes |
| `asset_ops_manager` | Approve/reject/modify recommendations, create work orders, record outcomes, submit feedback, capture expert interviews |
| `knowledge_steward` | Submit feedback, capture expert interviews, approve another steward's proposals, read audit trace |
| `auditor` | Read audit trace, all cases (read-only) |
| `admin` | All permissions |

A session cookie beats a spoofed `?user=` even on write paths (approval,
outcome) — see `tests/test_identity.py`.

## Testing

```bash
make test        # = PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest -q tests
make eval         # = PYTHONPATH=. python3 tests/evals/run_evals.py
```

**133 tests** (verified with `make test`; this count is a snapshot — run the
command for the current number) across spec acceptance cases, F1-F3
governance, identity, confidence, contrast/accessibility, and no-contradiction
checks:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_agent_state.py` | Core state-machine lifecycle, illegal transitions, guardrails G1/G5/G7/G8, audit tamper detection, multi-asset decision trees |
| `test_f1_escalation_api.py` | F1: G3 cross-domain escalation via the real API path |
| `test_f2_proposals.py` | F2: proposal workflow — pending → approve/reject → KB write-back → rollback, self-approval blocked, RBAC |
| `test_f3_refrigerant_leak.py` | F3: G2b forces `AWAITING_APPROVAL` (not escalate) for a safety-critical-but-actionable cause |
| `test_rbac_caps.py` | Declared vs. enforced RBAC capabilities |
| `test_capture.py`, `test_capture_review.py` | Expert capture: grounding, cause filing by owning pill, the four-step review flow |
| `test_adp_client.py` | ADP v2 SSE client against a simulated event stream |
| `test_kb_version_label.py`, `test_persistence.py` | KB version display; state survives a restart |
| `test_ai_second_opinion.py` | Phase 1: AI second opinion agree/disagree (G9), timeout/malformed fallback is audited, injected tag redaction, non-candidate cause rejection |
| `test_identity.py` | Phase 2: signed cookie beats a spoofed `?user=` (including on writes), tampered cookie rejected, insecure-mode fallback |
| `test_confidence_uplift.py`, `test_rerun_diagnosis.py` | Phase 3: approving validated feedback raises the next identical case's confidence by ≥0.05, rollback restores it exactly, non-destructive re-run preview |
| `test_no_contradictions.py` | Phase 4: no developer jargon ships, no diagnosis ≠ a confidence band, escalated cases never carry an actionable recommendation |
| `test_contrast.py` | Phase 5: every text/background pair ≥ 4.5:1 in both themes, parsed from the actual CSS tokens |
| `test_pill_registry.py` | Phase 6: `/pills` lists all four pills with the right owner and a real approval rate |
| `test_judge_fixes.py` | Rollback int/label reconciliation (`/kb/versions`), new condenser-fouling/cavitation assets reachable, rollback RBAC |

**`make eval`** runs 12 labelled acceptance evals (`EVAL-01`..`EVAL-12`) as a
pass/fail table, independent of the pytest suite: ADP call shape, AI cannot
bypass approval, AI failure fallback, unknown asset, canonical cause IDs,
persistence across a simulated restart, feedback governance, RBAC approval,
rollback, audit tamper detection, the RBAC matrix, and no invented evidence
in capture. See `tests/evals/run_evals.py`.

## Audit Integrity

Every state transition appends a record to a **SHA-256 hash chain** (spec §6):

```
record_n.prev_hash = SHA-256(canonical_json(record_{n-1}))
```

- `GENESIS_HASH` anchors the chain head.
- `verify_audit_chain()` recomputes the chain and detects any tampering.
- RBAC ensures only authorized roles can advance states; all actions are
  recorded with actor, timestamp, and transition name.
