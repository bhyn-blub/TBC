"""LLM provider seam for expert knowledge capture and the AI second opinion.

The diagnosis engine never calls a model: diagnosis stays deterministic so
the same evidence always yields the same verdict. The model's two jobs are
both advisory and both reviewed by a human before anything changes:

- *harvest* (``complete_json``): turning an expert's spoken or written
  account into structured draft knowledge that a human steward reviews.
- *second opinion* (``diagnostic_second_opinion``): an independent read on
  a completed rule-based diagnosis, shown to the Asset Operations Manager
  for context. It never routes, approves or executes anything — see
  ``ai_reasoning.py`` for the boundary that enforces this.

Both go through the same provider seam:

- ``mock`` (default): a deterministic offline responder so the demo runs
  with no API keys. Its output is clearly labelled ``mock`` in the UI.
- ``adp``: Tencent Cloud Agent Development Platform, over ``_call_adp()``.

Select with ``TBC_LLM_PROVIDER=mock|adp``.

Whatever the provider returns is treated as untrusted: ``capture.py`` and
``ai_reasoning.py`` validate the JSON shape, map causes onto the known cause
universe, and drop anything not grounded in what was actually supplied
(transcript quotes for capture, evidence readings for the second opinion).
