"""Tamper evidence must survive clean restarts (the "graceful shutdown
autosaves and silently overwrites" gap from JUDGE_REPORT_2026-10-07_round2.md).

Two complementary mechanisms:
  - load_state() archives + logs an ``audit_chain_failure_on_load`` event for
    any case whose SHA-256 chain fails re-verification, *before* any later
    save can overwrite the tampered snapshot;
  - save_state() compares the on-disk snapshot bytes against what the process
    last wrote/loaded and archives + logs a ``snapshot_modified_between_saves``
    event if they differ, catching edits made while the process is running
    (including across a graceful shutdown).
