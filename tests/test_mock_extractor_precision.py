"""Mock extractor precision: the judge's mis-tagging and under-suppression gaps.

Covers the two behaviours that sentence-wide keyword matching cannot get
right, and that the previous (sentence-scoped) negation fix traded between:

1. Collision mis-tags: one clause can match two causes ("batteries are at end
   of life" must draft `battery_eol`, not a generic sensor failure) -- even
   though "end of life" used to be a sensor keyword too.
2. Under-suppression: a denial in ONE clause must not swallow a real,
   separately-named cause in the sentence ("not the bus, but the thermistor is
   open-circuit" must still draft the sensor heuristic) -- the reason the
   extractor evaluates per clause.
3. Exoneration: "every tag on that bus was reporting fine" rules the bus out
   even with no negation word in the clause.
