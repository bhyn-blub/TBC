"""RBAC capability-registry invariant test (review finding R12).

Static scans app.py for every capability string passed to ``_need(user, "X")``
and asserts each is a declared member of the RBAC capability universe
(``rbac.PERMISSIONS`` values union + admin ``_ALL_CAPABILITIES``). This catches
typos / phantom capabilities at the API layer and turns "capability names need
verification" into a guarded invariant.

Also reports declared capabilities with NO enforcing endpoint
(``approve_knowledge_version`` / ``rollback_knowledge_version``) as a known
demo-scope gap (asserted-but-not-failed), surfaced in CI output.
